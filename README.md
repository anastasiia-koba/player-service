# Players Applications

Application allows to get information about players from Balldontlieâ€™s API.
You can get csv file with information about all players through REST endpoint or receive just receive updated information via WebSocket.
Application uses Ehcache with disk storage and keeps cache for playerId for 15 minutes.
Balldontlie API needs Api-Key for access, so I generated and used my own Api-Key.
You can change settings in [application.yml](src/main/resources/application.yml)
